## It's finished, so now what? {.blog_post_heading .anchor #finished_now_what}

Now that my blog is completely finished (well, I hope it's finished), it should
become quite apparant that post frequency is dropping like a rock, as I simply
have nothing to write about - or at least nothing I find the interwebs should
know about.

I wrote down a _maybe_ goal in [the post "Why this blog"](/blog/posts/2018/09-02_why/)
for post frequency:

> As for frequency, I don't expect to write up posts daily. Maybe at least once a
> week is reasonable for now.

It should be quite obvious I'm not going to make that now, especially now that
nothing's happening. This thus means this blog is going to be relatively silent
for, well, I think several years, where posts could occur months to years apart.
Fun, right?

While writing this up, I did think of some sort of biweekly thingy of 'observations'
made from the Old Faithful webcam during that time span. It'd make this blog not
as silent as I initially wrote down. Guess we'll have to wait and see... Then
again, winter is knocking on the door there, so full cam white-outs will become
frequent. Darn snow...
