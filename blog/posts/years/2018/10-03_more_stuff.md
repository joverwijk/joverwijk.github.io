## More Stuff {.blog_post_heading .anchor #more_stuff}

This will probably a one-of-a-kind. At least, for now. This is actually meant to
be a test post, though I may as well write some useful stuff up in here.

I am, as of writing, busy programming how my self-written blog script (I may as
well say that) looks up posts of years and months. This'll be rather useful, as
I do plan on limiting the amount of posts shown on the home page to 10 at a time.
This means that there is not much scrolling to do, as I do find long pages rather
annoying.

So... With that out of the way, I'm going back to coding now.

Oh. I do have to note that, even though most of it is automated now, there's
still more to automate. Yay! Ish...?
