## And It's Finally Complete! {.blog_post_heading .anchor #complete}

After many hours of work (to be honest, too many...) I've finally managed to
complete the blog partition (or at least for a large extent) and I'm very happy
with how it turned out.

The biggest issue I had, was that some queries didn't work, while they theoretically
and practically should have worked (at least according to me). I've managed to
fix all but one query issue. Ended up fixing that issue _the dirty way_, because,
well, I may as well if it doesn't work as expected.

And that more-or-less rounds up what's been happening behind the scenes. I'm
hoping to enjoy many years of using it.
