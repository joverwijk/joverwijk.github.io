So. After the [large post](/blog/posts/2018/12-02_on_curse_fandom_merge/) of
two days ago, a question which arose in me, was,

## Could This Work? {.blog_post_heading .anchor #could_it_work}

Yes and no.

### Yes {.blog_post_heading}

Surprisingly it could work. I wouldn't have expected this either.

How then? Put it simple: Gamepedia and Fandom both stay separate entities. This
means they both manage their own wikis (put 'manage' between quotes on Fandom's
part), have their own advertisements, etc.

Another way this could work is having some form of set rule that official wikis
stay on Gamepedia's platform (_including_ unofficial ones which were on there
before Fandom acquired with Curse), with unofficial ones hosted on Fandom.

I'd prefer both ones. This way they stay somewhat separate. Also, merging databases
wouldn't be a concern either. I actually wonder if 'database' is in Fandom's
dictionary.

### No {.blog_post_heading}

More often than not a merge doesn't work. I thus wouldn't be surprised if we get
some _Fandom_ shoved down our throat over at Gamepedia.

So why wouldn't it work? Put it simple - I pointed out some major issues over at
Fandom in my [previous post](/blog/posts/2018/12-02_on_curse_fandom_merge/).

Especially what makes me think this merge doesn't work for Gamepedia, is Fandom's
unfriendly staff. You are staff for a reason. As staff you are expected to care
about those who depend on you. As staff you should be serving those below you.
As staff you should be making choices which are beneficial for the community. As
staff you should be contributing to a better community, how large or small it is.
As staff you should have trust in and from the community. As staff you shouldn't
push through features which the community clearly doesn't want.

As staff you must be capable of _communicating_ with and through the community.
As staff you must be transparent with what you do and why. As staff you mustn't
copy-paste answers because it's easier to do so. As staff you ..._fill in_...

All things I just mentioned above are clearly lacking at Fandom. Over at Gamepedia
I haven't had (or am able to recall) any of such lacking experiences. And I do
not wish for Gamepedia to go down the path Fandom carved out.

### Going From Here {.blog_post_heading}

If Gamepedia gets some 'fandom' forced down its throat, I think many wikis will
fork from Gamepedia away to another platform or become independent, especially
wikis which have forked from Fandom in the past.

I'm fairly certain I'll be doing that with 'my' wiki ought this to occur (note
the quotes!). Makes host provider happy, I guess. Though I do think this will
be beneficial to the wiki's community, as we then can make our own decision,
rather than being dependant of some corrupt, non-caring company which can't deal
with critiscism _and copy-pastes answers_.

### Regarding The Previous Post {.blog_post_heading}

I'm still standing behind what I put in my previous post. Someone pointed out
that 'merge' is not the same as 'acquisition' (as in, Fandom acquired Curse).
It's all the same to me. On purpose? Probably. Should I care? I guess yes. Do I?
No. Period. I think that's why I dislike economics. Whatever.
