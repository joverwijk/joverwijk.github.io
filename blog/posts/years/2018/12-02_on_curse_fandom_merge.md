## My Opinion on Curse and Fandom Merging {.blog_post_heading .anchor #on_curse_fandom_merge}

Yesterday I was, well, you can't really call it _greeted_, surprised to find out
that apparantly Curse was acquired by Fandom/Wikia. I dislike this. Not only
because Fandom is horribly outdated, but also because their staff is rather
unfriendly to say the least. At least, that's what I've heard from others.

### What's Wrong With Fandom? {.blog_post_heading}

Short answer: everything. Period.

Long answer:

Recently, wikis hosted on Fandom were moving to Curse/Gamepedia, in order to
escape what Fandom is doing. To me the fact that Fandom did acquire Curse/Gamepedia,
sounds more like Fandom wanting to take control back over those wikis rather than
the usual _business as usual_, which happens on pretty much a daily basis.

I've also heard stories that Fandom staff is rather dominant over wikis hosted
by them. Not sure if this is true, but I wouldn't be surprised either that they
even have JavaScript checks... I actually understand that on one way, but on the
other hand it does painfully point out that Fandom doesn't have trust in their
very own (probably dedicated) contributers.

Forced video placement is on the list of _bad things to do_ as well. Not only
is it rather annoying to have a stupid, auto-playing video at the top of the page,
it also distracts the wiki's goal of providing information about a subject without
all kinds of nonsense around it.

Furthermore, they use some kind of modified, old MediaWiki version. 1.19, actually,
released mid-2012, with support ending in mid-2015. The current version is 1.31
and contains many security vulnerability fixes discovered since 1.19. This thus
puts Fandom at an unnecessary risk of being hacked, cracked, etc. and I'm fairly
certain authorities will point this very thing out if such an event ought to
occur. It's just a matter of time, a ticking time bomb.

Onto their skin. Let's just say there's more place for advertisements rather than
content. Or even, they want you to be able to see the background image/color/whatever
more than anything. You cannot do this. A wiki's purpose is to inform you about a
subject, not about looking at some random advertisement of some shady business
or a low-resolution, crappy mock-up image of a game (actually, why an image of the
game - a background containing randomly-generated lines, gradients and whatnot
should do fine, right? It's totally not 2018, where a simple lay-out is valued
over one where you don't know where to look at).

Oh. I see I haven't mentioned that they're using HTTP rather than HTTPS, because
HTTPS is _difficult to set up_, or at least _seems_ to be so, as they do have HTTPS
for people who have signed up and on their log in page.

So you're saying that all of your ad revenue, sponsored videos and news, probably
some kind of premium membership and whatnot IS NOT ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE AN HTTPS
CERTIFICATE for everyone because of subdomains? Shame. Just shame. I've seen
`subdomain.subdomain.subdomain.etc.domain`s with a valid HTTPS certificate.

> Shame. Just shame.

I hear you thinking: "Hold on there, not so fast. HTTPS doesn't automagically
mean that your site is secure." I know, I know. HTTPS is one of many factors
which are involved into making a better web together. Thus an admittetly major
site without such a certificate for everyone on their site browsing is just bad.
No other words left for that.

Also: is a talk page too complicated to use? A comment section under a page
containing more often than not complete and utter nonsense is just bad practice
when there is a good alternative. Using a talk page also has some kind of bump
to it, as in that it filters out most of the useless content, leaving comments
which are of value to both the wiki and the page in question.

### So What's Good About Fandom? {.blog_post_heading}

I do have to give them that everyone may set up a wiki without someone else involved
in the process. On the other hand, this does mean that those who think they are
'funny', can set up some kind of irrelevant wiki about "the history of light bulb
505a in the house at the river" or "what to do when you notice a mentally-ill
person takes charge of a country and they don't notice it themselves".

Other than this, I haven't seen anything good come out of the Fandom corner of
the internet... Which does tell something about the reputation of Fandom outside
its own 'filter bubble'.

### Playing the Devil's Lawyer {.blog_post_heading}

I can't of course write a somewhat 'neutral' post without writing up everything
I find bad about the platform I've been a member of for a couple of years.

Gamepedia has some form of feature (well, I can't really call it a feature, as it's
an annoyance to say the least) known as a _side rail_ - a block which goes down as
you scroll. In there is as much room for at least three square ad blocks. The
whole thing can take up as much as a quarter of the screen, which is obviously
not wanted. I do have to say you don't see that thing when you're logged in, so
that's a 'plus'.

Other than that major issue, I don't really see any other negativities about
Gamepedia itself. Their MediaWiki version is up-to-date (1.31 as of writing) and
content is put first rather than some bloaty video.

The response below that contains some points Gamepedia is supposedly missing. It
amuses me greatly:
* URL queries for customisation and debugging
* Custom JS review - a very key security feature
* Media embeds such as Spotify and Soundcloud
* Mobile skin & portability seem to not be a concern
* Cross-wiki notification history

My answer follows here, as I boycott Fandom (as in editing):
* URL queries: these are a core MediaWiki function. Gamepedia has them thus;
* Each wiki has their own _wiki manager_. They are the ones who, if I recall
correctly, do review of these things and revert malicious things. Furthermore,
they are the go-to person for things like enabling extensions and general issues;
* WHY ON EARTH DOES A WIKI NEED TO EMBED SPOTIFY AND SOUNDCLOUD? Gamepedia does
have an enable-able extension named "EmbedVideo", most commonly used to embed
YouTube videos in articles (usually in the article itself, _not_ at the top of
an article);
* We do have a mobile skin. Wikis usually don't style it, which, in return, is
the 'fault' of the admin;
* We also have cross-wiki notification history.

All those points brought up by the responder are thus invalid. Oh. VisualEditor
is nothing more than trouble, trouble, trouble here as well.

At least I found your comment, Phupperbat. To Fandom: NO. I shall never take back
ANYTHING I put in this post. DEAL WITH IT. EVEN IF THIS POST MEANS MY DEMISE!

Almost 100% certain the latter will happen.

### Continueing From Here {.blog_post_heading}

I look at this merge with skepticism. You promise so much good stuff, to only
find out (and ultimately denying) it wasn't any good at all, which usually happens.

Just take a look at North Korea and the United States - for years they were archenemies.
All of the sudden both North Korea and the US acted like 'nothing had happened'
and even a meeting between both leaders was organised. All good, right?

No. While North Korea pretends to lessen their enmity towards the rest of the
world, by for example destroying their watch towers at the border of South Korea,
they happily continue with developing their own rockets. This whole situation is
thus simply based on a sham friendship.

Going back to Curse being acquired by Fandom - this all smells like the North
Korea-rest of the world situation.

It's as if Fandom said to the outside: "Look: we've changed", while on the inside
it's still as rotten as ever.

Curse obviously took a bite in their hook.

This is how I look at this situation. You may disagree, but I don't care. I don't
care if you agree, disagree or feel neutral about it. I don't care if you file
a request to take this post down, I don't care if you share this post. This is
my opinion about this subject, no more, no less.
