## An Ominous Sight {.blog_post_heading .anchor #ominous_sight}

While watching the webcam, I saw a case where lighting was just right. This caused
a dark background on a light foreground.

Without further redo, here's the image:

### Recent Developments {.blog_post_heading}

As you may have noticed, it's been rather quiet since about mid-October. I'm rather
busy with other things, which basically comes down to less time to spend on both
my site and watching the webcam. I do think this will be changing either sooner
or later. Then again, it might not... Who knows?
