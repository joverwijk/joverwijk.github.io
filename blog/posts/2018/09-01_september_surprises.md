## September in Review (so far) {.blog_post_heading .anchor #september_surprises}

September really started off as a month having anything but something special to
it. Little did I know that was about to change, as on September 15 it all begun.

### Ear Spring {.blog_post_heading}

What would've been a rather uneventful ending of the day watching the Yellowstone
livestreaming cam, that changed when @ 1649 MDT (0049 CEST) Ear Spring erupted.
All I could reply with in chat, was "The heck is that?", followed by loads of
dings and gibberish. I may as well add that I initially saw that plume as one
coming from Plate, until I could quite clearly see muddy brown water at the base
of that plume.

So, I kept watching. Stayed up longer than I intended, to gather some more information
on that feature and to see what will happen next. And that's when the fun began.

### And the fun begins! {.blog_post_heading}

I kept seeing reports rolling in on GeyserTimes of features I thought didn't do
much or didn't even know of. Eventually this spread to the upper third of Geyser
Hill. I was especially surprised that North Goggle(s) started a series without
needing 'assistance' from Lion - it actually rendered Lion inactive for 3 days!
Result of that North Goggle(s) series was 232 logged(!) eruptions, out of which
a few were classified as 'intermediate'.

Aurum, while being in its 'summer mode', had probably the shortest series of
intervals recorded to date, with a couple around 2h15m. Maybe this was the result
of an influx of water? Such a thing happened a few years prior between Lion and
Depression, with as result extraordinarily long Lion series (up to 30+ eruptions)
and shorter intervals for Depression.

Several other features in that upper third of Geyser Hill became more active or
more powerful, notably UNNG-GHG-5 (sometimes informally referred to as 'Grove'),
Pendant Spring, Doublet Pool, Exclamation Point and those mentioned in the paragraphs
before.

Pump Geyser became less powerful in the hours following Ear Spring's eruption,
maybe related to UNNG-GHG-17's development?

In the hours and days following Ear Spring's eruptions, there were at least three
new developments: a geyser 16 feet north of Doublet Pool (UNNG-GHG-15), one right
of the trail leading to Solitary Geyser (UNNG-GHG-16) and a crack below the
boardwalk near Pump (UNNG-GHG-17), which has now grown into a geyser. The boardwalk
now also needs to be moved because of #17.

After three days of inactivity, Lion erupted again, this time with a series 19
eruptions long. This is definitely one of the longer series I've seen in a long
time. North Goggle(s) remained active throughout the series, though at a lower
pace. A few hours after the series, North Goggle(s) sped up again, though it
ended its series in the night after Lion.

Steamboat Geyser in Norris has had long eruptions in September, still at a rather
short interval. Leaves me thinking that heat is still in excess, though I do suspect
that when the eruptions become longer, eventually water will be in excess rather
than heat, so it's famous steam phase won't take place anymore.

There were a couple of Giants and Fan and Mortars, too. Morning still needs to
get there, but good to see it's active-ish again.

What else is left to write? Everything's good at school, so not much to report
there, if at all.
