## Major Steps Forward {.blog_post_heading .anchor #major_steps}

I did it. I bought myself a domain name, plus hosting package. It allows me to
do things I could normally not do due to GitHub's static pages.

Everything should be up soonÂ® and I am looking so darn forward to it. Once all
is done regarding the setup, I'll be moving. Hopefully that'll be happening during
the weekend, where I have time-o'-plenty.

I bought my domain name for a year. Same goes for hosting space. This means I'll
be able to work from that domain for a year straight, after which I can either
choose to let it expire _or_ buy an additional year or so. I hope I'll be able
to keep it, though.
