## It's Here! {.blog_post_heading .anchor #its_here}

It's finally here! I've moved all my files from GitHub to my server. This allows
me to do so much more than I could ever imagine.

### Future Plans {.blog_post_heading}

With that out of the way, it's now time to look at what's been done and what still
needs to be done.

To start with, I've added a nice category link to all posts, so that you can now
find all posts sorted by category.

Next comes up the GitHub thingy. I've removed almost all plain HTML files in favor
of saving those extra megabytes on my server. This also means that when trying
access any HTML file other than the default `index.html`, you'll get a nice 404
presented. And I honestly could not care less. Screw compatibility! Well...
Sometimes then... :)

With the list of things done out of the way, it's now time to look at what needs
to be done.

First comes up accessing posts for every year and month. This'll be done eventually,
but I can't give a date just yet. For now I'm happy with how it currently is,
even though it's currently still a WIP.

Then I also have the case of limiting the amount of posts shown on the blog home
page. I don't think I can limit the amount of function calls (or else I have not
found out how to do that just yet). This means I'll be doing that manually for
a while. Oh well... You can't have everything, right?
