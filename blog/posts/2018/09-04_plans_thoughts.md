## Plans and Thoughts {.blog_post_heading .anchor #plans_thoughts}

The more I'm starting to think about moving my website (or at least the blog
partition) to another host, the more I'm starting to like it. I've got the means
to do so (maybe domain name will be tricky, but I think I can sort that out), so
why not? It'll be rather useful in the future. Not just because of Yellowstone-related
stuff, but for basically a lot.

### Plans {.blog_post_heading}

Anyway, with all my thoughts out of the way, it's time for plans.

Blogs usually have categories, so I think I'll be integrating categories at some
point in the future. I further plan on having some kind of navigation menu in
there too. Not sure about search functionality, though. Maybe soon, too.

### Other stuff {.blog_post_heading}

As September comes to an end (as well as the summer), I think I can look back on
a great month. Some interesting stuff happened, that's one thing for sure. Here's
me hoping for a great October, in which more good stuff is hopefully coming.

Oh, I guess those dark months are on their way too... \*sigh\*
