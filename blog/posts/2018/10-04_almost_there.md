## Almost There... {.blog_post_heading .anchor #almost_there}

I managed to finally display dates for the navigation. This allows for better
navigation, especially when posts finally start disappearing on the blog home
page. Problem is, though, that the date page isn't quite working as it should.
\*sigh\*...

I need to get it working as soon as possible. Problem is, I don't see what's wrong
with how it fetches data from the database, as it's simply based on another script,
which works as intended. I hate these kinds of bugs (I may call them that as well)
as there doesn't seem to be any reason for those queries to not work as they should.
