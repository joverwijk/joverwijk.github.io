<h2 id="updates_frustrations" class="blog_post_heading anchor">Updates and FRUSTRATIONS</h2>
<p>I've <em>finally</em> managed to update my blog in such way that permalinks now <em>actually</em>
take you to separate pages, rather than jumping to a header on the same page.
Believe me, it was rather difficult for me to do that.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">Stupid regex</h3>
<p>The initial part of updating was quite easy, actually. Though because GitHub doesn't
support PHP natively (unless you're using some kind of 'approved' thingy named
Jekyll), I also have to convert my PHP pages to HTML. As the URLs I used for the
permalinks contain parameters, I can easily read them out in PHP using <code>_GET["param"]</code>.</p>
<p>However, as this doesn't work in HTML, I needed to convert them to static links.
And that's where that evil thing called <em>regex</em> came into play. Long story short:
I ragequitted because it did not work as I thought it would.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">The easy way</h3>
<p>As I mostly don't care <em>at all</em> about code conventions or on how to do things the
beautiful way, I simply ended up going the easy way: some <code>str_replace</code>s and that
was it. Take that! Is there a better way? Probably. Will I end up using it? No,
because it works now, right? Still disagree? Get out of here.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">Other thoughts</h3>
<p>Seen the fact that my frustration level with GitHub is now at an all time highest,
I'm thinking of moving my website to an <em>actual</em> host, and then one which supports
the latest PHP version and more. This way I won't break my head over things like
these and I can implement loads of other cool stuff which will make my life easier.
