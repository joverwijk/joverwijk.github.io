                    So... Apparantly I  made a blog. Fun stuff, right? Anyway, I'll let
                    you alone now. Have fun reading!

                    Note: Be aware of some wild speculation when reading. This is simply me thinking
                    out loud, don't put any value to that. Unless you're one of <i>those</i>
                    persons.

<h2 id="why_this_blog" class="blog_post_heading anchor">Why this blog?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering why I made this blog. Simply because I like to write up
my thoughts on various things, really. It may also become handy in the future,
once I make it to Yellowstone or any other place. Then I have a nice place to
write up my observations, ramblings and whatnot.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">Reasoning...</h3>
<p>With the usefulness of this blog out of the way, why did I bother creating it?
There are loads of other blog scripts around. You'd say I could easily utilise
that software instead, rather than 'fighting' with my current setup. Well then...
I sometimes like to challenge myself. And I did that with this. I always wanted
to write down observations of things I've seen on the Old Faithful streaming
webcam, especially after what happened on <a href="#september_surprises" title="Post: September Surprises">Geyser Hill on the 15th of September</a>.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">...searching...</h3>
<p>And thus, in a burst of creativity, I looked for how to code a blog in PHP. I then
clicked on some links and found out it was actually possible to write text in
Markdown and then have PHP convert it to HTML. And thus my search continued, this
time for a PHP parser which converts Markdown to HTML. I then ended up at
<a href="http://parsedown.org" title="Parsedown website">Parsedown</a> (<em>not sponsored</em>). After
looking at its documentation, I downloaded their standard script, only to soon
after discover I may as well get its extension to do some more technical stuff.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">...creating</h3>
<p>So, with that being set up, it was now time to get things going. Created all things
necessary and it was time for a test run.</p>
<p>I'm glad I didn't decide to immediately publish the changes publicly, as, well,
there were a few errors. Two I was able to fix in an instand - the other one
required some more research. Found out the main Parsedown script was outdated.
So I got its most recent version and it worked. Trust me, this doesn't happen
often. And then it was time to actually create the first blog post I've ever written.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">The future</h3>
<p>It's obviously not going to take long before the current setup needs some more
work. As it currently stands, the page will get long at a reasonable pace. This
is obviously not what I want. I'd like to limit the amount of posts to around
ten at a time, which sounds reasonable to me. I then also need to create something
with <em>actual</em> permalinks, rather than links to a heading on this page.</p>
<p>As for frequency, I don't expect to write up posts daily. Maybe at least once a
week is a reasonable frequency for now.</p></article><article class="blog_post"><p class="date">26 September 2018 | <a href="/html/blog/index.html#september_surprises" title="Copy link from URL bar in browser">permalink</a></p>
<h2 id="september_surprises" class="blog_post_heading anchor">September in Review (so far)</h2>
<p>September really started off as a month having anything but something special to
it. Little did I know that was about to change, as on September 15 it all begun.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">Ear Spring</h3>
<p>What would've been a rather uneventful ending of the day watching the Yellowstone
livestreaming cam, that changed when @ 1649 MDT (0049 CEST) Ear Spring erupted.
All I could reply with in chat, was "The heck is that?", followed by loads of
dings and gibberish. I may as well add that I initially saw that plume as one
coming from Plate, until I could quite clearly see muddy brown water at the base
of that plume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heck is that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I kept watching. Stayed up longer than I intended, to gather some more information
on that feature and to see what will happen next. And that's when the fun began.</p>
<h3 class="blog_post_heading">And the fun begins!</h3>
<p>I kept seeing reports rolling in on GeyserTimes of features I thought didn't do
much or didn't even know of. Eventually this spread to the upper third of Geyser
Hill. I was especially surprised that North Goggle(s) started a series without
needing 'assistance' from Lion - it actually rendered Lion inactive for 3 days!
Result of that North Goggle(s) series was 232 logged(!) eruptions, out of which
a few were classified as 'intermediate'.</p>
<p>Aurum, while being in its 'summer mode', had probably the shortest series of
intervals recorded to date, with a couple around 2h15m. Maybe this was the result
of an influx of water? Such a thing happened a few years prior between Lion and
Depression, with as result extraordinarily long Lion series (up to 30+ eruptions)
and shorter intervals for Depression.</p>
<p>Several other features in that upper third of Geyser Hill became more active or
more powerful, notably UNNG-GHG-5 (sometimes informally referred to as 'Grove'),
Pendant Spring, Doublet Pool, Exclamation Point and those mentioned in the paragraphs
before.</p>
<p>Pump Geyser became less powerful in the hours following Ear Spring's eruption,
maybe related to UNNG-GHG-17's development?</p>
<p>In the hours and days following Ear Spring's eruptions, there were at least three
new developments: a geyser 16 feet north of Doublet Pool (UNNG-GHG-15), one right
of the trail leading to Solitary Geyser (UNNG-GHG-16) and a crack below the
boardwalk near Pump (UNNG-GHG-17), which has now grown into a geyser. The boardwalk
now also needs to be moved because of #17.</p>
<p>After three days of inactivity, Lion erupted again, this time with a series 19
eruptions long. This is definitely one of the longer series I've seen in a long
time. North Goggle(s) remained active throughout the series, though at a lower
pace. A few hours after the series, North Goggle(s) sped up again, though it
ended its series in the night after Lion.</p>
<p>Steamboat Geyser in Norris has had long eruptions in September, still at a rather
short interval. Leaves me thinking that heat is still in excess, though I do suspect
that when the eruptions become longer, eventually water will be in excess rather
than heat, so it's famous steam phase won't take place anymore.</p>
<p>There were a couple of Giants and Fan and Mortars, too. Morning still needs to
get there, but good to see it's active-ish again.</p>
<p>What else is left to write? Everything's good at school, so not much to report
there, if at all.</p></article>                <p class="small_right">
