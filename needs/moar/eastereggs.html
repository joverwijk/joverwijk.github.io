    <h3>Think again then.</h3>
    <p>
        You see, it would be rather easy to have something hidden here, but wouldn't
        that be too easy to find?

        I see what you're thinking... Screw you, right? Well then. Honestly I
        don't care at all. KTHXBYE.

    <!--
        Well, well, well... you're not giving up all that easily. I see. Still,
        there's absolutely NOTHING to find here. NOTHING. Absolutely NOTHING!
        Why are you still reading this then? Wasting your time on this, rather
        than doing more useful stuff.
        
        Sure, go ahead. I can guarentee you'll not
        get these seconds, minutes(??), hours(?!) and days(!!) back. You read it,
        you'll not get your time reading this back.

        Actually... Why was I typing all this stuff then? Ugh... I guess I was
        bored then. Sure... I'll go with that then. Have fun finding more eastereggs.
        I can guarantee you there are none... For now... KTHXBYE!
